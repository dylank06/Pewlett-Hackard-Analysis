First, I had to creat the retirment titles page to get the list of people who could be possibly retiring based of off the year that they were born. The error in this table was that it did not get rid of duplicate names so the final number count would have been inaccurate using this table

This lead me to creating the unique titles table. This is the accurate number of people who could retire based on their age and ordered by their employee numbers.

The retiring titles uses the counts the different titles in the unique titles tab for the analysis.
